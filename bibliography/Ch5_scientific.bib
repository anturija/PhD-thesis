	shorttitle = {Reassembling the social},
	abstract = {Reassembling the Social is a fundamental challenge from one of the world's leading social theorists to how we understand society and the 'social'. Bruno Latour's contention is that the word 'social' as used by Social Scientists has become laden with assumptions to the point where it has become a misnomer. When the adjective is applied to a phenomenon, it is used to indicate a stabilized state of affairs, a bundle of ties that in due course may be used to account for another phenomenon. Latour also finds the word used as if it described a type of material, in a comparable way to an adjective such as 'wooden' or 'steely'. Rather than simply indicating what is already assembled together, it is now used in a way that makes assumptions about the nature of what is assembled. It has become a word that designates two distinct things: a process of assembling: and a type of material, distinct from others. Latour shows why 'the social' cannot be thought of as a kind of material or domain, and disputes attempts to provide a 'social explanation' of other states of affairs. While these attempts have been productive (and probably necessary) in the past, the very success of the social sciences mean that they are largely no longer so. At the present stage it is no longer possible to inspect the precise constituents entering the social domain. Latour returns to the original meaning of 'the social' to redefine the notion and allow it to trace connections again. It will then be possible to resume the traditional goal of the social sciences, but using more refined tools. Drawing on his extensive work examining the 'assemblages' of nature, Latour finds it necessary to scrutinize thoroughly the exact content of what is assembled under the umbrella of Society. This approach, a 'sociology of associations' has become known as Actor-Network-Theory, and this book is an essential introduction both for those seeking to understand Actor-Network-Theory, or the ideas of one of its most influential proponents.},

	isbn = {978-0-415-69205-2},
	shorttitle = {Urban {Assemblages}},
	abstract = {This book takes it as a given that the city is made of multiple partially localized assemblages built of heterogeneous networks, spaces, and practices. The past century of urban studies has focused on various aspects—space, culture, politics, economy—but these too often address each domain and the city itself as a bounded and cohesive entity. The multiple and overlapping enactments that constitute urban life require a commensurate method of analysis that encompasses the human and non-human aspects of cities—from nature to socio-technical networks, to hybrid collectivities, physical artefacts and historical legacies, and the virtual or imagined city.  This book proposes—and its various chapters offer demonstrations—importing into urban studies a body of theories, concepts, and perspectives developed in the field of science and technology studies (STS) and, more specifically, Actor-Network Theory (ANT). The essays examine artefacts, technical systems, architectures, place and eventful spaces, the persistence of history, imaginary and virtual elements of city life, and the politics and ethical challenges of a mode of analysis that incorporates multiple actors as hybrid chains of causation. The chapters are attentive to the multiple scales of both the object of analysis and the analysis itself. The aim is more ambitious than the mere transfer of a fashionable template. The authors embrace ANT critically, as much as a metaphor as a method of analysis, deploying it to think with, to ask new questions, to find the language to achieve more compelling descriptions of city life and of urban transformations. By greatly extending the chain or network of causation, proliferating heterogeneous agents, non-human as well as human, without limit as to their enrolment in urban assemblages, Actor-Network Theory offers a way of addressing the particular complexity and openness characteristic of cities.  By enabling an escape from the reification of the city so common in social theory, ANT’s notion of hybrid assemblages offers richer framing of the reality of the city—of urban experience—that is responsive to contingency and complexity. Therefore Urban Assemblages is a pertinent book for students, practitioners and scholars as it aims to shift the parameters of urban studies and contribute a meaningful argument for the urban arena which will dominate the coming decades in government policies.},

	abstract = {The long term planning in Yugoslavia is usually associated with early 1930s and with issuing of the Building Code in 1931, which represented the first official document legally regulating planning and construction of cities and towns. The term planning in its nowadays meaning has first appeared only after the Second World War. In 1949 the Act on General Urban Plan (GUP) was issued and according to many authors that was a crucial point that marked the very beginning of the long term planning in Yugoslavia. Since then its development has been characterized by numerous changes resulting from the political, economic and social modifications and tendencies, as well as influences from other environments and disciplines. Finally, in the mid-1960s a paradigm of GUP was established, which despite several modifications regarding some methodological and procedural questions, has remained unchanged up to our day. The General Urban Planning in Yugoslavia has developed in a paradigm manner, in Kuhn’s sense of meaning. In this paper this fifty year process has been explored and discussed. Kuhn’s views and theory on the structure of scientific revolution have provided the conceptual background for it, and helped in guiding analysis of the phenomena as well as in explaining certain phases or particular facets within each of them. The General Urban Planning has undergone the whole process of a paradigm change but with a specific pace of progress, with some of the phases being very long and others being exceedingly short. In this paper this process has been reviewed and development of the GUP model presented and discussed. To illustrate the point the case study of the city of Belgrade has been drawn.},
