	abstract = {This paper deals with technologies, catalysts for change, and their links to development. Indeed, particularly for developing and emerging countries, scientific and technological breakthroughs create wonderful opportunities, but they may also convey risks that should not be overlooked. This leads to crucial questions on the nature of technological innovation and its capacity to fulfill the specific needs of certain societies. Thus, the issue of investing in priority sectors to guarantee more sustainable development for the benefit of all is paramount, as is the question of the stakeholders' direct or indirect involvement in this scientific, technological, and socioeconomic development process. Access to technologies is one of the last vital issues to be addressed. The paper, therefore, explores the question of the existence of exclusively urban technologies and their adaptability to city-related territorial and societal issues in emerging and developing countries and the key factors on which this adaptability will depend.},

	doi = {10.1068/b160127},
	abstract = {This paper concerns the distinction between 'good' and 'bad' planning. Three views of the planning process are distinguished, with their associated criteria of the quality of plans: planning as control of the future, implying that plans not implemented indicate failure; planning as a process of decisionmaking under conditions of uncertainty, where implementation ceases to be a criterion of success, but where it becomes difficult, therefore, to give stringent criteria of the quality of a plan; and a view holding the middle ground, where implementation is still important but where, as long as outcomes are beneficial, departures from plans are viewed with equanimity. Similar distinctions are drawn in the implementation literature and in the literature on programme evaluation. The authors seek to develop a rigorous approach to evaluation under conditions of uncertainty. For this purpose, the authors draw on the policy-plan/programme-implementation-process (PPIP) model developed by Alexander and give five criteria for comprehensive evaluation: conformity, rational process, optimality ex ante, optimality ex post, and utilisation. The procedure is outlined in considerable detail, by means of tables and flowcharts. The framework confronts the dilemma that, although policy and planning must face uncertainty, we must at the same time be able to judge policies, plans, and their effects.},
