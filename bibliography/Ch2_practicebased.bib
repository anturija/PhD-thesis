	abstract = {Improving the livability of our towns and cities commonly 
starts at the street, block, or building scale. While larger 
scale efforts do have their place, incremental, smallscale 
improvements are increasingly seen as a way 
to stage more substantial investments. This approach 
allows a host of local actors to test new concepts before 
making substantial political and financial commitments. 
Sometimes sanctioned, sometimes not, these actions 
are commonly referred to as “guerilla urbanism,” “popup 
urbanism,” “city repair,” or “D.I.Y. urbanism.” For 
the moment, we like “Tactical Urbanism,” which is an 
approach that features the following five characteristics: 
• A deliberate, phased approach to instigating 
change; 
• The offering of local solutions for local planning 
challenges; 
• Short-term commitment and realistic expectations; 
• Low-risks, with a possibly a high reward; and 
• The development of social capital between citizens 
and the building of organizational capacity between public-private institutions, non-profits, and their constituents.},
