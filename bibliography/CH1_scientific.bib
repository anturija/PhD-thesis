They are due to approaches and instruments that do not correspond to the realities of the developing city including the prevalence of informal sector and slums, urban governance problem, and few resources. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) now offer enormous possibilities to use information flows, communication, and land-use models better. ICTs offer solutions that take greater account of informal activities, enable discussions with civil society and Internet forums to take place, etc. ICTs can enhance the planning of developing cities, if conditions are right. The chapter provides a review of the situation in developing cities. It analyses the challenges and potential of using ICTs to improve urban planning. Lastly, it puts forward key conditions for the successful and relevant implementation of ICTs in order to create the best conditions for real technological added value.},

	abstract = {John Friedmann addresses a central question of Western political theory: how, and to what extent, history can be guided by reason. In this comprehensive treatment of the relation of knowledge to action, which he calls planning, he traces the major intellectual traditions of planning thought and practice. Three of these--social reform, policy analysis, and social learning--are primarily concerned with public management. The fourth, social mobilization, draws on utopianism, anarchism, historical materialism, and other radical thought and looks to the structural transformation of society "from below." After developing a basic vocabulary in Part One, the author proceeds in Part Two to a critical history of each of the four planning traditions. The story begins with the prophetic visions of Saint-Simon and assesses the contributions of such diverse thinkers as Comte, Marx, Dewey, Mannheim, Tugwell, Mumford, Simon, and Habermas. It is carried forward in Part Three by Friedmann's own nontechnocratic, dialectical approach to planning as a method for recovering political community.},

Built on the considerable foundations of the landmark first (1994) and second editions (2000) the Third Edition moves qualitative research boldly into the 21st century. The editors and authors ask how the practices of qualitative inquiry can be used to address issues of social justice in this new century.  As with the second edition, the Third Edition represents virtually a new handbook. There are 14 totally new topics, including, among others, indigenous research, institutional review boards and human subject research, critical and performance ethnography, arts-based inquiry, narrative inquiry, Foucault, the ethics and strategies of on-line research, cultural and investigative poetics, the politics of evaluation. Over half of the 42 chapters are written by new authors. Every returning chapter has been thoroughly revised and updated. The organization is clear and sensible, moving from the general to the specific and from the past to the present and the future.  The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research is far-reaching and comprehensive, featuring a virtual `Who's Who' in the human sciences.

Few indeed are the philosophers or historians influential enough to make it into the funny papers, but Kuhn is one. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is indeed a paradigmatic work in the history of science. Kuhn's use of terms such as "paradigm shift" and "normal science," his ideas of how scientists move from disdain through doubt to acceptance of a new theory, his stress on social and psychological factors in science-all have had profound effects on historians, scientists, philosophers, critics, writers, business gurus, and even the cartoonist in the street. Some scientists (such as Steven Weinberg and Ernst Mayr) are profoundly irritated by Kuhn, especially by the doubts he casts-or the way his work has been used to cast doubt-on the idea of scientific progress. Yet it has been said that the acceptance of plate tectonics in the 1960s, for instance, was sped by geologists' reluctance to be on the downside of a paradigm shift. Even Weinberg has said that "Structure has had a wider influence than any other book on the history of science." As one of Kuhn's obituaries noted, "We all live in a post-Kuhnian age." -Mary Ellen Curtin},

	abstract = {Many professions have defined a spectrum of roles that in various degrees balance case work with systemic work. Using the metaphor of editing, and borrowing from multiple professional fields, this paper offers a framework for conceiving of urban design. This paper suggests that (1) â€˜urban designâ€™ is an overarching term for a school of professions and disciplines that focus on the physical design of our settlements and their component pieces (just as â€˜medicineâ€™ includes doctors, nurses, epidemiologists); (2) within this â€˜schoolâ€™ we can articulate a spectrum of roles that range from those focused on individual cases, through editorial roles, to those addressing systemic issues.},

	doi = {10.1177/1356389007084674},
	abstract = {This article proposes ways to use programme theory for evaluating aspects of programmes that are complicated or complex. It argues that there are useful distinctions to be drawn between aspects that are complicated and those that are complex, and provides examples of programme theory evaluations that have usefully represented and address both of these. While complexity has been defined in varied ways in previous discussions of evaluation theory and practice, this article draws on Glouberman and Zimmerman's conceptualization of the differences between what is complicated (multiple components) and what is complex (emergent). Complicated programme theory may be used to represent interventions with multiple components, multiple agencies, multiple simultaneous causal strands and/or multiple alternative causal strands. Complex programme theory may be used to represent recursive causality (with reinforcing loops), disproportionate relationships (where at critical levels, a small change can make a big difference — a `tipping point') and emergent outcomes.},
